# Potential Plans

Question: How can we use pixel density ratios to evaluate vegetation infectious status?

Aspects to consider are:
Illness onset-historical data
Blood culture results
Use of antibiotics
Blood chemistries such as CBC and inflammatory markers
Hospital course- febrile status
PET scanning

There may be other indicators of infectious status. The above are time related.
